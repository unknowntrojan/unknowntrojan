# __ü§ó your friendly neighbourhood reversing enthusiast ‚òïÔ∏è__

My name is __unknowntrojan__, but I'm usually abbreviated as __unknown__. My pronouns are he/him. I am a native german speaker, although I speak both german and english fluently. You can reach me on Discord under _unknowntrojan#2814_. __All opinions expressed are _mine_ and _mine_ alone.__

I've been obsessed with computers and programming my entire life. The first language I properly learned was C, and it was my daily driver for a very long time. I love working close to hardware and have had my fair share of fun in homebrew and embedded scenes, especially with Nintendo consoles. My work also familiarized me with x86 Assembly. Nowadays I spend a lot of time doing CrackMe's, reading up on old CTF challenges, exploring anticheats and analyzing malware.

I'm a very dedicated hobby-level ‚ú®reverse engineer‚ú®. I love trying to understand other's intentions while programming and finding ways to exploit the littlest mistakes. I love the process and have spent most of my teenage years "hacking" games, exploiting both the OS and games themselves for fun and profit, gathering experience in reversing and bughunting. This is my preferred career path.

I have recently discovered ü¶Ä Rust ü¶Ä, and I am completely baffled at how amazing of a language it is. I use it wherever possible.

My experience is not just limited to backend or systems programming, however. While front-end web development is most definitely not my strong suit, I do still find it enjoyable and have made websites utilizing styling projects such as picocss and tailwindcss, tooling like htmx, and other lightweight frontend technologies. I personally dislike the SPA framework approach like with React and Angular.

I have always hosted my own infrastructure. My favorite Linux Distribution by far is Fedora Linux, for both Desktop and Server usage. I am familiar with contemporary virtualization and containerization technologies and have used them extensively to host my VCS, CI/CD along with the  occasional games and such.
