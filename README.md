# _your friendly neighbourhood hacker_

My name is **unknowntrojan**, although I frequently go by just **unknown**. I go by he/him. I am a native german speaker, although I speak both german and english fluently. You can reach me on Discord under _unknowntrojan#2814_.

I've been obsessed with computers and programming my entire life. My first real language was C, and it was my daily driver for a very long time. I love working close to hardware and have had my fair share of fun in homebrew and embedded scenes, especially with Nintendo consoles. My work also familiarized me with x86 Assembly. Nowadays I spend a lot of time doing CrackMe's, exploring anticheats and analyzing malware.

I have recently discovered ðŸ¦€ Rust ðŸ¦€, and I am completely baffled at how amazing of a language it is. I use it where possible.

Related to my love of low-level code, I'm a dedicated âœ¨reverse engineerâœ¨. I love trying to understand other's intentions while programming and finding ways to exploit mistakes. I spent most of my teenage years "hacking" games, exploiting both the OS and games themselves, gathering experience reversing and bughunting.

My experience is not just limited to the backend, however. Web development is most definitely not my strong suit, but I do still find it enjoyable.

I have always hosted my own infrastructure. I am familiar with contemporary virtualization and containerization technologies and have used them for complete CI/CD pipelines for my personal projects.
