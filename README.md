# __☕️ your friendly 🤗 neighbourhood breakpoint summoner 🔴__

My name is __unknowntrojan__, abbreviated __unknown__. I go by __he/him__. I was born and currently live in Germany 🇩🇪.

All opinions expressed are _mine_ and _mine_ alone.

I am a native German speaker, and fluent in English.

I love the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, _"hacking"_ (reverse-engineering, binary exploitation, malware analysis) and having fun screwing around with software, especially on Windows. I manage my own servers, utilizing container technologies.

__Tabs > Spaces__. If you think otherwise, I kindly invite you to leave.

## More About Me

I've been obsessed with computers and programming my entire life. The first language I properly learned was C, and it was my daily driver for a very long time. I loved working close to hardware and have had my fair share of fun in the homebrew and embedded scenes, especially with Nintendo consoles. Nowadays I spend a lot of time reading up on old CTF challenges, reversing anticheats and malware. Definitely one of my favorite pastimes.

I have recently discovered the language [Rust (🦀)](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and I am completely starstruck. I try to use it wherever possible.

I'm a very dedicated hobbyist ✨reverse engineer✨. I love the process of trying to understand the programmer's intentions, how they may have screwed up, and finding ways to exploit even the littlest mistakes.

__Going forward, this line of work is my preferred career path.__

Most of my youth was spent _"hacking"_ games, exploiting the games' code for fun and profit, gathering experience in both reversing and finding bugs. If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that __assumptions are deadly__. Almost all exploitable bugs I've encountered stem from the fact that user input is erroneously considered trusted.

My programming experience is not just limited to backend or systems programming, however. While front-end web development is most definitely not my strong suit, I do still find it partially enjoyable and have made websites utilizing libraries like [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and other lightweight frontend technologies, along with styling projects such as [pico.css](https://picocss.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I personally dislike the popular SPA framework approach like with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

My services have always been hosted on my own infrastructure. My favorite Linux Distribution by far is [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/), both for Desktop and Server workloads. I am familiar with the Linux CLI and contemporary containerization technologies and have used them extensively throughout my personal projects, for example to host my VCS ([Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)), CI/CD ([Woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org/)) and the occasional game server.
