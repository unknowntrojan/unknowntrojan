# <p align="center">__Hi, I'm unknowntrojan__</p>

I love reverse engineering, the Rust programming language, owls, cats and evergreens.

I have a blog at [unknowntrojan.win](https://unknowntrojan.win), feel free to take a look! I haven't spent much time on it yet, so there may not be much to see.

If you're looking for slides or information about my talks, see [here](https://github.com/unknowntrojan/talks).
