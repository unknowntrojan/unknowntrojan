# __☕️ your friendly 🤗 neighbourhood 🔴 breakpoint wizard 🧙__

My name is __unknowntrojan__ (or simply __unknown__), and I go by __he/him__.

I was born and currently live in Germany 🇩🇪 and speak both English and German fluently.

I hold a burning passion for __"hacking"__ (especially __reverse-engineering__, __malware analysis__ & __binary exploitation__) and have been ___hacking away___ (get it?) at anything I could get my hands on ever since I first touched my dad's computer.

Furthermore, my recent discovery of the [Rust (🦀)](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language has had me _completely starstruck_ and lead to a spree of me re-writing some of my projects in it. Rust has firmly placed itself as my favourite language.

## More About Me

I've been obsessed with computers and programming my entire life. The first language I properly learned was C, and it was my daily driver for a very long time. I loved working close to hardware and have had my fair share of fun in both the homebrew and embedded scenes, especially with Nintendo consoles. Nowadays I spend a lot of my time reading up on old CTF challenges as well as reversing anticheats and malware. Definitely one of my favourite pastimes.

__Going forward, this line of work is my preferred career path.__

Most of my youth was spent _"hacking"_ games, exploiting flaws in the games' code for fun and profit, gathering experience in both reversing and finding bugs.

If there's one thing I've learned from this over the years, it's that __assumptions are deadly__. Almost all exploitable bugs I've encountered stem from the fact that __programmers erroneously consider user input trusted__.
I'm very dedicated when it comes to reverse engineering. I love the process of trying to understand the programmer's intentions, how they may have screwed up, and finding ways to exploit even the littlest mistakes. This has also made me a very cautious programmer.

My services and projects have always been hosted on my own infrastructure. My favorite Linux Distribution by far is [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) for both Desktop and Server workloads. I am familiar with the modern Linux CLI and contemporary containerization technologies and have used them extensively throughout my personal projects, for example to host my VCS ([Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)), CI/CD ([Woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org/)) and, occasionally, a game server or two.

My programming experience is not just limited to backend or systems programming, though. While front-end web development is most definitely not my strong suit, I do still find it partially enjoyable and have made websites utilizing libraries like [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and other lightweight frontend technologies, along with styling projects such as [pico.css](https://picocss.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I personally dislike the popular SPA framework approach the likes of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

Moreover [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) is a project I am really excited about, although I haven't had the time to work with it _yet_. Did I mention it can be used to basically __completely thwart__ the efforts of code obfuscators and virtualizers? 😉

__Tabs > Spaces__. If you think otherwise, I can refer you to a good therapist.
