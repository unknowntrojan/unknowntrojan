# _your friendly neighbourhood hacker_

My name is **unknowntrojan**. I'm german, and I go by he/him. I speak both german and english fluently.

I've been obsessed with computers and programming my entire life. My first real language was C, and it was my daily driver for a very long time. I love working close to hardware and have had my fair share of fun in homebrew scenes, especially with Nintendo consoles. My work also familiarized myself with x86 Assembly. Nowadays I spend a lot of time doing CrackMe's, exploring anticheats and analyzing malware.

I have now tried Rust, and am completely baffled at how amazing of a language it is. There are barely any circumstances under which I still prefer one of my more "classic" languages.

My experience is however not just limited to the backend. Although web development is most definitely not my strong suit, I do still find it enjoyable.

I have always hosted my own infrastructure. I am familiar with contemporary virtualization and containerization technologies and have used them for complete CI/CD pipelines for my personal projects.

Related to my love of low-level code, I'm a dedicated âœ¨reverse engineerâœ¨. I love trying to understand other's intentions while programming and finding ways to exploit mistakes. I spent most of my teenage years "hacking" games, exploiting both the OS and games themselves, gathering experience reversing and bughunting.

Here is a list of technologies I am very comfortable with:
